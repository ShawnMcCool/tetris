- the implementation concept of 'matrix' becomes 'minos'
- there's only tetrimino, not active tetrimino
- start position is a part of the game
- there's no need for a playfield
- unit tests
- standard layout is 10,20 not 10,40
- add 'render character' to mino
- Tetrimino is 4 minos, it was in the name all along
