# Tetris

## Requirements

### Must Haves

- 7 tetriminos: O, I, T, L, J, S, and Z, each made up of 4 minos
- the matrix: the play-field may be of any size, however standard is 10 minos wide and 40 minos tall
- line clear: when a line is completely cleared, remove it from the board and drop lines until all empty lines are above the top-most mino in the matrix
- lock down: the moment a tetrimino locks into place and can no longer be moved
- tetris notification: reward the player with a notification when they clear a tetris (4 lines at once)

### Nice to Haves

- lock down delay: extra time given to the player to rotate the piece before it's permanently snapped into place
- hard drop: drop a tetrimino from the current position directly into lock down by tapping 'up'
- soft drop: increase the speed at which a tetrimino falls by holding 'down'
- scoring
